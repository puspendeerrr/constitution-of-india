      <div class="historical-context">
        <h3>Historical Context</h3>
        <p>Directive Principles were inspired by the Irish Constitution and reflect the socialist ideals of the freedom movement. They represent the social and economic goals that India aspired to achieve. Unlike Fundamental Rights, they are not justiciable but serve as a moral compass for governance and legislation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="current-status">
        <h3>Current Status</h3>
        <p>Many Directive Principles have been implemented through various laws and policies. The Right to Education Act, MNREGA, various social welfare schemes, environmental protection laws, and labor laws are examples of implementation. However, some principles like the Uniform Civil Code remain contentious and unimplemented.</p>
