        <h3>Historical Context</h3>
        <p>Fundamental Rights were inspired by the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They were incorporated to protect individual liberties against arbitrary state action and to ensure the dignity and freedom of every citizen. The framers of the Constitution were deeply influenced by the freedom struggle and wanted to create a society based on justice, liberty, and equality.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="current-status">
        <h3>Current Status</h3>
        <p>Fundamental Rights continue to be the bedrock of Indian democracy. The Supreme Court and High Courts have expanded the scope of these rights through judicial interpretation. Article 21 (Right to Life) has been particularly expanded to include various rights like right to education, right to health, right to clean environment, etc. These rights are not absolute and can be reasonably restricted in the interest of public order, morality, and security.</p>
