        <h3>Historical Context</h3>
        <div class="context-content">
          <p>Part XXI was designed to ensure a smooth transition from British colonial rule to independent India. The framers of the Constitution recognized that immediate implementation of all constitutional provisions might cause disruption, so they created temporary provisions to facilitate gradual transition while maintaining stability.</p>
          
          <p>Many of these provisions have been repealed or modified over time as India has evolved. The most significant recent change was the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019, which removed the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. However, several provisions continue to be relevant, especially those protecting regional and tribal interests.</p>
